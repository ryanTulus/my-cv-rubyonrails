        <p>Dear Respected Manager,</p>
        <p>I am writing this letter as an expression to display my strong interest in applying for the &ldquo;Software Engineer&rdquo; position, as listed on your company profile.</p>
        <p>As a recent graduate, I am currently holding a bachelor degree in Computer Science with Honours from University of New South Wales. I am a self-motivated, practical person who has passion in developing mobile and web technologies. Having developed web applications in PHP, Java and Ruby on Rails, I am sure that I can use these skills to be a value to your company. Prior to this, I have working experience in Gomeeki and Black Nova Digital as an android developer.</p>
        <p>As seen from my resume, I have exposure over a series of web scripting language; such as HTML5, CSS3 and AngularJS. Using these scripting languages, I have built a movie-based web application in PHP to improve the structure, design and layout of the web page. By having this mixture of skillset, I believe I am able to assist in improving the quality of your service.</p>
        <p>Throughout my university coursework, I have had experiences in using Linux machine environment to develop all my academic projects. Aside from my university projects, I am a technology enthusiast that thrives in learning new technologies. Outside of my university degree, I have been learning Ruby on Rails, android, HTML5, CSS3, jQuery and AngularJS to further pursue my passion. I am also well knowledgeable with OOP and have developed a Connect4 and ROMA game that uses a series of design patterns. </p>
        <p>On one of my personal project, I have demonstrated clear ability to get &ldquo;the shit done&rdquo;. This project is a movie website similar to the iMdb website. I built this project on a purpose to provide people with an informative channel that will assist them in making the right decision to watch movies. I used PHP to deal with the server-side operation in fetching movies data from MySQL database, whilst using a combination of HTML5, Bootstrap (CSS3), and AngularJS to design a user-friendly layout. In here I demonstrate a clear ability to plan, design and implement the project.</p>
        <p>With consideration of my skills, experience and knowledge, I strongly believe that I am the right candidate for the position. Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your response.</p>
        <p>Sincerely yours,</p>
        <p>Ryan Tulus</p>
